Mahnpower
=========

Machine mod companion for SiegeTech

Mahnpower is all about using the raw strentgh of the player to accomplish what other tech mods use energy for.

Automation is useable through vanilla means, (hoppers) but this mod will not be adding things like conduits and item ducts.

Overall, Mahnpower is a clockwork themed tech mod with the intention to keep things "low tech" and potentially adding a bit of mild magic.


---IDEAS---

Tools that amplify your yield from ores instead of machinery.  Sorta stealing the hammer> ore gravel > ore sand > ore dust idea from Ex Nihlio

Prospecting chisel > use on ore, get ore shards

Prospecting hammer > use on ore shards, get ore chunks

Prospecting pick > use on ore chunks, get ore nuggets


Add gems from prospecting ore, ala WoW jewlcrafting.

Use gems to do...something.  Better weapons? Trade for rare items? Different armor? Magic?  Maybe magic, since then it gives a player a choice of tech vs magic?


Mahnkenizms

Each Tier has 2 varients. Precise and Tough.  Precision MKs are faster but store less energy. Tough MKs are slower but store more energy.  Any MK can be used as a rechargeable furnace fuel.

In the Machines, they serve as power source and upgrades.

Advanced Mahnkenisms

Advanced MKs are a combination of Basic MKs. They are built on Clockwork Bench.

Depending on what basic Mahnkenisms are used, the resulting advanced MK's stats are differnt.  Each Advanced MK has a Precision and Toughness rating.  These are combined from the basic MKs that make up the Advaned one.  So, four Wooden MKS make a single advanced MK with a precision of 8 and toughness of 4. (Toughness rating of 1 and Precsion rating of 2 for each wooden mahnkenism)


Machines -- Furnace, Ore processor(place hammer/chisel/prospector pick in it and it uses it on the ore), Charging gear box (place a bunch of MKs in it and it will charge them all by punching the thing)
